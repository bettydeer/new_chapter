		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>I am taking this class to launch myself into the next chapter. At this exact moment, I am not entirely clear what that chapter is. What I do know is that I am at a crossroads in my career, and as it happens, in my life. It's been a little over a year since I moved out here, following my heart and leaving behind a ten year career with only one company. It had been a good run, but I was and am, open to new directions. Turns out--that is considerably harder than it sounded. And after a year of sporatic freelance, several part-time jobs, and a lot of soul searching, I have arrived at the conclusion that the world of tech and the web may just be my answer. What that exactly means, I am not yet certain. But I needed to know what I didn't know. As in, how do I feel about this type of work in reality? Will it become an exciting brand new career direction, or a really helpful skill to add to design work? This class appeared on my radar at just the right moment, exactly when I was ready to jump in!

		<h2>Concerns about learning HTML</h2>
		<p>The concerns I have about learning HTML hover around my previous rather lame attempts to do so. Being a designer in the modern age, people have been telling me for ages, and with more vehemence for the last year or so, that web knowledge is extremely important. I would try...watch a video, not have an immediate use, get frustrated/overwhelmed (or both) and go back to my comfort zone. However, I actually LIKE languages--especially vocabulary, and technology, so I suspect it is all a matter of just white knuckling my way in and doing it. Which is precisely why I'm here, to confront my fear of the unknown world of web!</p>
